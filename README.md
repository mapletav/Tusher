# Tusher
Tusher is a project which endeavors to establish a succession of practical functions and mini-games founded upon the SkriptLang language belonging to the Minecraft [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) plugin.

<br>The structure of the repository is as follows:

```
Tusher
    |____  .github // Save the assets files
        |____ ...
    |____ .sk // Skript Scripts
        |____ ...
    |____ LICENSE
    |____ README.md
```

## ðŸ’¬ Translation
All the files are mainly in `Chinese`, and generally, files in languages other than English will not be proactively released. Therefore, if you are a player using other languages, you are welcome to make a `pull request` to provide the translated files at any time.

Language Contributor:
<br>`zh-cn` @[Mapletav](https://github.com/mapletav)
<br>`en-us` 

File Naming Rule:
```
Tusher-[script name]_v.[version]_[language code].sk
```

## ðŸ“† Plan

> Given that there are scripts available in the community that implement this functionality, I might not consider writing it for the moment 

3ï¼‰Some mini-games under consideration
<br>4ï¼‰......
